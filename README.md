# Obsidian HTML Entity Auto-replace

Automatically replaces any HTML entities you type, such as &amp;alpha; with their decoded counterparts, such as Î±.

No configuration, just automatically converts any html entities you type, as soon as you type them.

Only converts entities when they end in a semicolon.

## Install instructions

1. Go to the `.obsidian/plugins` folder in your vault and create a new folder there.
2. Download manifest.json and main.js from the Releases tab (on the right) and place them inside the folder.
3. Enable the plugin in the Community Plugins tab of Obsidian's settings.

I used the code of [jon-heard/obsidian-text-expander-js](https://github.com/jon-heard/obsidian-text-expander-js) as a
guide for creating this plugin.
