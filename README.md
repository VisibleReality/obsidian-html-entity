# Obsidian HTML Entity Auto-replace

Automatically replaces any HTML entities you type, such as &amp;alpha; with their actual counterparts, Î±.

No configuration, just automatically converts any html entities you type, as soon as you type them.

Only converts entities when they end in a semicolon.

I used the code of [jon-heard/obsidian-text-expander-js](https://github.com/jon-heard/obsidian-text-expander-js) as a
guide for creating this plugin.
